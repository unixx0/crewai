2025-12-19 20:22:48: task_name="None", task="This task is related for performing mathematical calculations on the basis of given user query: Can you find 3+6-7/9%6 followd by 6+6/2Step 1: Read the full user query carefully and identify the two separate arithmetic expressions that need to be solved: (a) 3 + 6 - 7 / 9 % 6 and (b) 6 + 6 / 2.
Step 2: Recall the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS): Parentheses → Exponents → Multiplication/Division → Modulo → Addition/Subtraction. Note that division, multiplication, and modulo have the same precedence and are evaluated from left to right.
Step 3: Solve Expression (a) 3 + 6 - 7 / 9 % 6
   a. Compute the division 7 / 9. Since both numbers are integers, perform floating‑point division: 7 ÷ 9 = 0.777777…
   b. Apply the modulo operation with the result of the division and 6: 0.777777… % 6. Modulo with a divisor larger than the dividend returns the dividend itself, so the result is 0.777777…
   c. Now perform the remaining addition and subtraction from left to right:
      i. 3 + 6 = 9
      ii. 9 - 0.777777… = 8.222222…
   d. Round the final result to a reasonable number of decimal places (e.g., 6 decimal places): 8.222222.
Step 4: Solve Expression (b) 6 + 6 / 2
   a. Compute the division first: 6 / 2 = 3.
   b. Perform the addition: 6 + 3 = 9.
Step 5: Verify each intermediate calculation for arithmetic accuracy. Double‑check that the modulo step in Expression (a) was handled correctly (the remainder of a smaller number divided by a larger number equals the smaller number).
Step 6: Prepare the final response to the user, clearly presenting both results in the order requested:
   - Result of 3 + 6 - 7 / 9 % 6 = 8.222222 (approximately)
   - Result of 6 + 6 / 2 = 9
Step 7: Communicate the answer politely, optionally offering a brief explanation of the steps taken for transparency.
Step 8: End the interaction after confirming the user is satisfied or offering to help with additional calculations.", agent="Math Teacher", status="started"

   - Identify the two separate arithmetic expressions: (a) 3+6-7/9%6 and (b) 6+6/2.
2. **Recall Operator Precedence Rules**
   - Parentheses (none present).
   - Exponents (none).
   - Multiplication, Division, Modulo (left‑to‑right).
   - Addition and Subtraction (left‑to‑right).
3. **Break Down Expression (a): 3+6-7/9%6**
   a. Compute the division part: 7 ÷ 9 = 0.777777... (retain sufficient decimal precision).
   b. Compute the modulo of the division result with 6: 0.777777... % 6 = 0.777777... because the dividend is smaller than the divisor.
   c. Now handle addition and subtraction left‑to‑right:
      - First addition: 3 + 6 = 9.
      - Then subtraction: 9 - 0.777777... = 8.222222... (rounded as appropriate, e.g., 8.2222).
4. **Break Down Expression (b): 6+6/2**
   a. Compute the division first: 6 ÷ 2 = 3.
   b. Perform the addition: 6 + 3 = 9.
5. **Verify Calculations**
   - Re‑evaluate each step mentally or with a simple calculator to ensure no arithmetic mistake.
6. **Prepare the Final Response**
   - Clearly present the results in the order asked by the user.
   - Example wording: "The result of 3+6-7/9%6 is approximately 8.2222, and the result of 6+6/2 is 9."
7. **Deliver the Answer**
   - Output the final results to the user in a concise, friendly manner, ensuring the numbers are formatted consistently (e.g., two decimal places if desired).
8. **Optional: Explain the Process**
   - If the user seems interested, briefly describe why the division and modulo were performed before addition/subtraction, reinforcing the operator precedence rule.
